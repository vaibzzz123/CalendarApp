have array of events posted so far, in the tuple format
have array of divs that hold the event, and their width, etc.

when inserting new event:
* find overlapping events in array one
* if there are overlapping events:
    * go into array2. resize those events to take up half space to the left
    * insert new event into array1
    * insert new event into array2, resizing so it takes up the right side portion
* otherwise
    * insert into array1
    * insert into array2, taking maximum width of container
