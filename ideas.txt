have array of events posted so far, in the tuple format
have array of divs that hold the event, and their width, etc.

when inserting new event:
* find overlapping events in array one
* if there are overlapping events:
    * go into array2. resize those events to take up half space to the left
    * insert new event into array1
    * insert new event into array2, resizing so it takes up the right side portion
* otherwise
    * insert into array1
    * insert into array2, taking maximum width of container

actually nah that hasn't worked

new approach: levels, divs inside the calendarContainer div

* Will start with 1 level, and will have a max level counter
* look for all overlapping elements, sort them by level (will have element, level tuple)
* find first level where I can insert such that the elements don't overlap at that particular level
* if level doesn't exist, create it, increment counter
* if there are overlapping elements on other levels
    * split them into before currentLevel and after currentLevel
    * Find closest levels of overlapping elements (before and after), width = (closestAfter-closestBefore)/closestAfter * maxWidth (set to maxLevel and 1 respectively at start of search)
    * resize all elements that are overlapping of last level to maxWidth/(level of new event I'm inserting) (actually idk)

OR

do the non-overlapping intervals problem
    * remove all items from the calendar if required
    * find all intervals in the set such that removing them gets rid of overlap, put remaining intervals into one level
    * repeat the same process for the removed intervals, until there are none
    * these will be our levels
    * insert the elements one by one, starting from the biggest level
        * set width of any particular
